# C++ Exception Handling
This repo contains code examples for exception handling in c++. Build the repo using the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```

Once compiled, the build directory will contain two folders ```exception_handling``` and ```custom_exception_handling```. The directory ```exception_handling``` contains executables of examples explaining exception handling properties. The directory ```custom_exception_handling``` contains executables of custom exception handling examples.

**_NOTE_**: During compilation, several warnings are reported. They are left for the purpose of understanding the behaviour of exception handling in different situations.
